# Python Assignments üêç

This repository contains two Python assignments demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as **Classes**, **Constructors**, **Inheritance**, **Encapsulation**, and **Polymorphism**.

---

## üìÇ Files Included
1. **assignment1.py**  
   - A class-based program featuring:
     - A parent class `Device`
     - A child class `Smartphone` inheriting from `Device`
     - Attributes and methods to simulate real smartphone actions like calling and charging
   - Demonstrates:
     - Class attributes & methods
     - Constructors (`__init__`)
     - Inheritance & Encapsulation

2. **assignment2.py**  
   - A polymorphism challenge with different vehicle classes (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`) sharing the same method `move()` but behaving differently.  
   - Demonstrates:
     - Method overriding
     - Polymorphism in action
